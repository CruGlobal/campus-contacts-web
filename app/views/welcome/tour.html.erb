          So, you get home from a long day of being on campus. The newsletter needs to be written, and you have a stack of cards that now you have to plug in to an Excel spreadsheet.
        </p>
        <p>
          You think to yourself, “I’m on staff with Campus Crusade. I am supposed to HATE Excel spreadsheets.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And at least 17 surveys are filled out by students who obviously never took a class in penmanship, because you can’t even read their email address. Their J’s blend into their L’s, or so it appears.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Jesus loves them, and you need to contact them. But you can’t help wondering...

    	<h2 style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 5px;">So what if...</h2>
      <p>You never lost another contact card · You could assign new contacts to your staff and student leaders and easily manage it online · You had all of the Facebook profile information for your leadership team in one place · You could track how well your team completed follow-up · You could create a unique online survey for each event that connected to a student’s profile ·Your smart phone helped you manage your contacts · Every one of your leaders (that you approve) have access to your online contacts-list for follow-up · You could use iPad®, iTouch®, iPhone®, Android® or any web-enabled device as your new “clipboard” with a digital survey instead of a paper survey · You had a record of every interaction leaders have with every student who signs up · You never have a problem with legibility on paper surveys</p>
      <h2 style="text-align: right;">...things just got better.</h2>

      <h2>You can meet students where they are</h2>
      <p>There is no going back. This generation is spending a generous portion of their time online, and we need to be there to share the Gospel. MissionHub puts you in the middle of all the thunder-thumb action.</p>
      <p>Your missional community is literally at the fingertips of students, because now they can interact with you through social networks and through text messaging.</p>

      <h2>Creative ways to reach out to new students</h2>
      
      <p><span style="font-style:italic; font-weight: bold;">“...and if you want to get more connected to Cru, text UCF to 69940.”</span><br/>
        When students send a simple text message, it creates a contact card in your online community for each of them. Technology begins to work for you now. Your community’s MissionHub will invite students to give you more information through Facebook and to fill out a survey with other questions you specify. This allows new students to see how your community can help them to get plugged in while you collect thier contact information.</p>
