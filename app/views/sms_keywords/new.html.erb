<p class="title1 center">Request an SMS Keyword</p>
<p class="explanation1">In order to get the most out of the system it is important for you to choose a keyword to work with our SMS shortcode.  
  Choosing a keyword for your community or event enables you to begin user registration via text message. The process of acquiring new keywords
  requires manual intervention. Once you request your keyword an email will 
  be sent to the website administrator who will process the request. You will be notified when the keyword is approved.  </p>
